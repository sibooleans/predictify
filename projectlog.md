Collaboration Reflections

We used GitHub for version control and VS Code Live Share to pair on debugging.  
Although we both came in with little experience, we divided tasks based on interest and supported each other frequently. We learned to communicate blockers quickly, and our work aligned well thanks to shared checkpoints and daily check-ins.

Weâ€™re proud of the progress and look forward to building more advanced features together in the next phase.
